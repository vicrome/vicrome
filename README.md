- 👋 Hi, I’m @vicrome
- 👀 I’m interested in development of software and new technologies!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning vue.js
- 💞️ I’d love to get my hands on Electron! Such an interesting technology!
- 📫 You can contact me on vicro96@gmail.com

I've worked with all of these technologies thought the years:
Java, C#, Python, PHP, Vanilla Js, Vuejs, Angularjs, html, css, mysql, MongoDB, FireBase, Android, Docker, TypeScript, Jenkins, Handelbars, Webpack, AWS (EC2, S3), Bash, Git, Oracle, UE4, Unity .. and tons more i might have forgoten about!

I'll name a few of the proyects I have worked in on my own, and while most of them wont ever be avaiable here, some might:
'Movies for friends' Android app -> A tinder like swipable for movies, that coupled with your friends gave you matched movies to watch together! Including and not only: social groups, incoming movies, theater movies, push notifications, friends in-app, ads (in development), youtube links for trailers, netflix/amazon/wherever the show was casted on your country links. Used TheMovieDB Api for data and FireBase for management
'Zombie game' Multiplayer Zombie game -> Mini proyect w/ a friend, hosted an EC2 instance w/ the server for the game, made with UE4 and C++ and Blueprints, could host up to 4 players and zombies came chasing you, you could shoot them OUT!
'Lets Fly!' Mini python script which used Amadeus API to get the cheapes tickets to fly in and out x country (could be the cheapest) given a date and x flexibility
'Calculator' A calculator I did for my Android course :D
'Candy Crush' I reacreated it on a python script which run the game on the terminal, had 20 levels ~
Also did a couple of games w/ Python and PyGTK for my uni courses, such as a minesweeper with hexagonal sections and a puzzle game!
